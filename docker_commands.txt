docker build -t bowling_img .
docker run -it --rm --name bowling_game bowling_img

Important Notes
If you're planning to use audio input/output in the container, you'll need to:
Run the container with audio device access:

bash $ docker run --device /dev/snd your_image

Consider adding ALSA or PulseAudio support if you need audio functionality
The error in your original build occurred because pip was trying to compile PyAudio without having the required PortAudio development files available.

X11 Forwarding:

docker run -it --rm \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  --name bowling_game bowling_img

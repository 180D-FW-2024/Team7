Not all code was written by us. This file gives credit for code reuse.

### position_tracker/position_tracker.py

The motion-tracking tool was adapted from https://github.com/Practical-CV/Simple-object-tracking-with-OpenCV. We added code that calculates the player's distance from the center of the field of view along the x-axis and sends this data via socket to the game.

### remote/remote.ino

The code that runs on the ESP32-C6 is adapted from the built-in Arduino examples for Bluetooth Low Energy and the ICM-20948.
